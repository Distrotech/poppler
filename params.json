{"name":"Poppler","tagline":"Mirror of git://anongit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler","body":"This is poppler, a PDF rendering library.\r\n\r\nPoppler is a fork of the xpdf PDF viewer developed by Derek Noonburg\r\nof Glyph and Cog, LLC.  The purpose of forking xpdf is twofold.\r\nFirst, we want to provide PDF rendering functionality as a shared\r\nlibrary, to centralize the maintenance effort.  Today a number of\r\napplications incorporate the xpdf code base, and whenever a security\r\nissue is discovered, all these applications exchange patches and put\r\nout new releases.  In turn, all distributions must package and release\r\nnew version of these xpdf based viewers.  It's safe to say that\r\nthere's a lot of duplicated effort with the current situation.  Even if\r\npoppler in the short term introduces yet another xpdf derived code\r\nbase to the world, we hope that over time these applications will\r\nadopt poppler.  After all, we only need one application to use poppler\r\nto break even.\r\n\r\nSecond, we would like to move libpoppler forward in a number of areas\r\nthat don't fit within the goals of xpdf.  By design, xpdf depends on\r\nvery few libraries and runs a wide range of X based platforms.  This\r\nis a strong feature and reasonable design goal.  However, with poppler\r\nwe would like to replace parts of xpdf that are now available as\r\nstandard components of modern Unix desktop environments.  One such\r\nexample is fontconfig, which solves the problem of matching and\r\nlocating fonts on the system, in a standardized and well understood\r\nway.  Another example is cairo, which provides high quality 2D\r\nrendering.  See the file TODO for a list of planned changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note that xpdf, and thus poppler, is licensed under the GPL,\r\nnot the LGPL.  Consequently, any application using poppler must also\r\nbe licensed under the GPL.  If you want to incorporate Xpdf based PDF\r\nrendering in a closed source product, please contact Glyph & Cog\r\n(www.glyphandcog.com) for commercial licensing options.\r\n\r\n\tKristian HÃ¸gsberg, Feb. 27, 2005\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the README-XPDF for the original xpdf-3.03 README.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
